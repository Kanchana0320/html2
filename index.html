1	"Wildcat Is Down"	Glenn Ficarra & John Requa	Dan Fogelman	January 26, 2025	1PTV01
Agent Collins goes for a morning jog, then prepares for his duty as a Secret Service Agent. In the residence of President Bradford, Collins discovers the President dead and bleeding on the floor. Collins examines the premises and discovers that the President's safe has been raided. He also examines the security footage and discovers that the footage froze for a few hours after his last contact with the live President. Collins suspects foul play by Agent Robinson, who has been sleeping with the President. Collins asks Agent Billy Pace to check the perimeter outside the President's house before asking Agent Jane to call in a Code Red. Flashbacks show that President Bradford personally recruited Agent Collins to be his lead Secret Service agent and that once Collins took a gunshot on behalf of the President, saving his life. When Collins returned to duty after surgery and rest, President Bradford revealed a top-secret project being built inside the mountains in Colorado in preparation for an extinction level event. A flashback of the night before the death shows that Collins was resentful towards the President for an unapparent reason and told the President that he'll forgive Bradford when he sleeps again, and he'll sleep again when Bradford is dead. The outro shows a digital signboard indicating that the dawn is delayed by two hours due to scheduled maintenance and a flyby reveals that they are living inside a domed construction inside a mountain with a large, powerful light source supplying artificial sunlight to the settlement.
2	"Sinatra"	Glenn Ficarra & John Requa	Dan Fogelman & Katie French	January 28, 2025	1PTV02
In a flashback, Samantha Redmond brings a team of brilliant people to a secret excavation inside a mountain and asks them to build her a city. In the present day, Agent Collins dreams of a memory where he speaks to his wife over a satellite phone before the white flash of an explosion blinds him through the aircraft windows. Collins awakens and is taken for questioning by Agent Robinson. En route, Collins asks why the mistress of the President is heading the investigation, to which Robinson replies she has a strong alibi. In the questioning using a lie detector equipment, Collins openly shares that Robinson was sleeping with the President, and Robinson asks Collins if he murdered the President. After he replies that he didn't, Robinson asks Collins to walk through the event. Dr. Torabi interrupts them and asks Robinson to leave. She then asks Collins if a part of him is happy that the President is dead, and prompts him to answer yes with a note in her hand. Dr. Torabi tells Redmond that Collins is telling the truth as he wouldn't admit to hating the President if he had murdered him and is lying. The public is called to the town hall where the death of the President is announced and a new President is sworn in. A flashback shows then-Senator Bradford meeting with Redmond at a conference where a speaker tries to warn that the world will end due to natural causes, but is greeted with an almost empty auditorium. Redmond asks the speaker what they should do, to which he replies to dig a hole in a mountain and get inside. At the town hall, Collins tells Billy that he's suspicious of Redmond (nicknamed Sinatra), and he plans to bring her down.

Agents Collins and Pace go for a run to discuss the situation, where Collins warns Pace to be careful. Collins barges into the office of Dr. Torabi to ask why she told him to say yes, to which she asks him to take a walk. A pathologist performs an autopsy on the President's body and informs that the weapon is a blunt object, and the DNA results will take a day or two. Dr. Torabi tells Collins that the President seemed disturbed a week before his death. She then asks Collins to tell her about his father. A flashback shows Collins informing his father that his wife is pregnant. In another flashback, he asks his father to retire due to the onset of Parkinson's. With Redmond's orders, Robinson asks to find out about the camera blackouts using digital footprints. Pace
